# pricepredictionmodel
This a python project practicing machine learning and data visualisation predicting housing prices in Mumbai and in Delhi


So for this project I am going to 3 things
1) Read and analyse a data file
2) Do some regression analysis to check price v/s area correlation for place like Mumbai (Mumbai is a city in India)
3) Make a machine learning model which can predict price for any value for area
4) Use the model for any other dataset
5) Make an interactive model

So let's get started

First thing is to get some libraries and read our dataset (In this case mumbai.csv)

We can see the data and it looks fairly without a problem.

We will get into how many different kinds of data are available

Next I checked the values and their ranges

For the next step we will import more libraries for data analysis, visualisation and machine learning
I wil also try to clean the data (Refer the code for more info)

Now I will remove all the values which are non-numerical and check for correlations between all the different variables in the dataset
