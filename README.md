# pricepredictionmodel
This a python project practicing machine learning and data visualisation predicting housing prices in Mumbai and in Delhi


So for this project I am going to 3 things
1) Read and analyse a data file
2) Do some regression analysis to check price v/s area correlation for place like Mumbai (Mumbai is a city in India)
3) Make a machine learning model which can predict price for any value for area
4) Use the model for any other dataset
5) Make an interactive model

So let's get started

First thing is to get some libraries and read our dataset (In this case mumbai.csv)
